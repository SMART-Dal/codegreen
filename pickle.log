2023-11-04 02:09:28.821223: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary
is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in 
performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
2023-11-04 02:09:28.951026: I tensorflow/core/util/port.cc:104] oneDNN custom operations are on. You 
may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different 
computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
